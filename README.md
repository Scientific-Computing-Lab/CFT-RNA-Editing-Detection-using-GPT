# CFT-RNA-Editing-Detection-using-GPT

##Overview
RNA editing is a crucial post-transcriptional mechanism that alters RNA sequences, impacting gene regulation and disease. This repository contains code for predicting adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing sites using GPT-4o-mini with a continual fine-tuning (CFT) strategy.

We introduce a liver-specific dataset, where ADAR1 is the predominant enzyme, and train models progressively on editing thresholds (1%, 5%, 10%, 15%), improving classification accuracy compared to traditional fine-tuning methods.
