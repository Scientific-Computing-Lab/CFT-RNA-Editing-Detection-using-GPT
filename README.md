# CFT-RNA-Editing-Detection-using-GPT

## Overview
RNA editing is a crucial post-transcriptional mechanism that alters RNA sequences, impacting gene regulation and disease. This repository contains code for predicting adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing sites using GPT-4o-mini with a continual fine-tuning (CFT) strategy.

We introduce a liver-specific dataset, where ADAR1 is the predominant enzyme, and train models progressively on editing thresholds (1%, 5%, 10%, 15%), improving classification accuracy compared to traditional fine-tuning methods.

### Key Contributions:
   - Liver-Specific RNA Editing Analysis: Avoiding confounding multi-tissue variability.
   - Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT): Training the model step-by-step from low (1%) to high (15%) editing levels.
   - Non-Overlapping Thresholds: Each site assigned a single editing category to improve classification accuracy.
   - Improved Performance: Outperforms GPT-3.5 and static fine-tuning (SFT) models.

## ðŸ§¬ Methodology
Our approach focuses on improving RNA editing site prediction using transformer-based models, specifically **GPT-4o-mini**, in a **continual fine-tuning (CFT)** paradigm. This methodology allows the model to progressively learn from lower to higher editing thresholds (1%, 5%, 10%, 15%), refining its understanding of RNA editing patterns.

We trained the model using a **liver-specific dataset** derived from GTEx, ensuring minimal interference from non-relevant ADAR isoforms. The training procedure included:

A) **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Extracting double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structures from Alu elements.
   - Annotating editing levels based on GTEx liver data.
   - Predicting RNA secondary structures using ViennaRNA(RNAfold) and converting into Vienna format.

   **Data Partitioning**
   - Overlapping Sites: Multiple thresholds assigned per site (e.g., 1-5%, 5-10%).
   - Non-Overlapping Sites: Each site belongs to one distinct threshold to ensure clearer distinctions.

B) **RNA Editing as a Classification Problem**

   - Framing RNA editing site prediction as a binary classification task.
   - The model determines whether a given adenosine is edited (Yes/No) based on its sequence and structure.
   - Training labels are derived from GTEx data, assigning a binary label to each adenosine.

C) **Comparing Fine-Tuning Strategies (SFT vs. CFT)**

   - Static Fine-Tuning (SFT): Training on a single threshold (e.g., only 15% editing).
   - Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT): Gradual training from low (1%) to high (15%) editing levels.
   - CFT enables better adaptation across editing ranges, leading to more robust classification performance.
